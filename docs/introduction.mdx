## Core Technical Principles

<summary>**Security Architecture:**</summary> 
* Security is paramount. We employ hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for system access, and adhere to industry best practices to safeguard operations and delegated assets.

# Blockport FAQ

## 1. About Blockport & The Rebrand

**Q: What is Blockport?**
* **A:** Blockport (`blockport.xyz`) is the new identity for the high-performance Solana validator previously known as Zeta Node. We're an independent infrastructure provider run by the same experienced team.

**Q: Why did Zeta Node rebrand to Blockport?**
* **A:** Rebranding allows us to focus independently on our mission: providing best-in-class staking and future infrastructure services (like RPCs) for the *entire* Solana ecosystem. It gives us the operational freedom to expand our offerings.

**Q: Is this related to the Zeta Markets / Bullet.xyz rebrand?**
* **A:** We maintain a positive relationship with Bullet.xyz, and they support this transition [link/mention endorsement if available]. However, Blockport is now a fully independent entity with its own distinct mission focused on foundational infrastructure.

**Q: Who is behind Blockport?**
* **A:** Blockport is operated by a team with deep Solana experience, including roles supporting early ecosystem growth and building with prominent DeFi protocols, backed by 3+ years of proven validator operation. [Link to personal blog post if desired].

## 2. For Delegators (Especially from Zeta Node)

**Q: I was staked with Zeta Node. Do I need to do anything?**
* **A: No.** The validator identity key has *not* changed. Your delegation continues seamlessly with Blockport. No action is required.

**Q: Is my staked SOL safe?**
* **A:** Yes. Your funds remain securely staked to the same underlying validator infrastructure. Blockport uses the same robust security practices and hardware operated under the Zeta Node name.

**Q: Is Blockport run by the same team as Zeta Node?**
* **A:** Yes, the same core team with 3+ years of experience managing this validator is running Blockport.

## 3. Staking with Blockport & Fees

**Q: What are Blockport's commission fees (for public/pool delegators)?**
* **A:** We charge **0% inflation commission** and **8% MEV commission**. We currently retain 100% of block rewards as programmatic distribution is not yet feasible on Solana (this may change post-SIMD123).

**Q: Why 0% inflation commission?**
* **A:** We believe in maximizing direct staking rewards for our delegators. Our model focuses on performance-driven income (MEV/block rewards) and future services.

**Q: Have you ever raised fees?**
* **A:** No. We are committed to transparency and have maintained our public commission structure since inception (over 3 years).

**Q: How do I stake with Blockport?**
* **A:** Please see our staking guide here: [Link to Staking Guide in Docs/Website].

## 4. Performance & Security

**Q: What is Blockport's performance history?**
* **A:** We have operated continuously for over 3 years with a proven 99.9% uptime record, ensuring consistent rewards. [Link to performance dashboard/stats if available].

**Q: How does Blockport ensure security?**
* **A:** We employ multi-layered security, including HSMs for key management, MFA for access, robust monitoring, and secure infrastructure across multiple data centers. [Link to relevant docs section].

**Q: How do you optimize staking yields?**
* **A:** Through high uptime, optimized hardware (AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro, NVMe), strategic data center locations, and a focus on efficient block production and MEV capture.

## Core Technical Principles

Blockport is built on the following technical principles:

* **Reliability & Uptime:** We prioritize operational stability through redundant infrastructure across multiple continents, proactive monitoring (automated and manual), and rigorous incident response protocols. Our 3+ year track record reflects this commitment.
* **Performance Optimization:** Our validators utilize carefully selected hardware (including AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro CPUs and high-speed NVMe drives) and optimized configurations specifically tailored to meet Solana's demanding performance requirements, maximizing yield potential.
* **Security Architecture:** Security is paramount. We employ hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for system access, and adhere to industry best practices to safeguard operations and delegated assets.
* **Transparency:** We believe in clear communication and predictable operations. Our public commission structure (0% inflation / 8% MEV) is stable â€“ we have never raised public fees since inception.
* **Ecosystem Contribution:** We actively support Solana's health and decentralization through participation in the official delegation program and by operating a dedicated testnet validator.

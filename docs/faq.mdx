# Blockport FAQ

### 1. About Blockport
<details>
<summary>**What is Blockport?**</summary>
* **A:** Blockport (`blockport.xyz`) is the new identity for the high-performance Solana validator previously known as Zeta Node. We're an independent infrastructure provider run by the same experienced team.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**Why did Zeta Node rebrand to Blockport?**</summary>
* **A:** Rebranding allows us to focus independently on our mission: providing best-in-class staking and future infrastructure services (like RPCs) for the *entire* Solana ecosystem. It gives us the operational freedom to expand our offerings.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**Is this related to the Zeta Markets / Bullet.xyz rebrand?**</summary>
* **A:** We maintain a positive relationship with Bullet.xyz, and they support this transition. However, Blockport is now a fully independent entity with its own distinct mission focused on foundational infrastructure.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**Who is behind Blockport?**</summary>
* **A:** Blockport is operated by a team with deep Solana experience, including roles supporting early ecosystem growth and building with prominent DeFi protocols, backed by 3+ years of proven validator operation.
</details>
### 2. For Delegators
<details>
<summary>**I was staked with Zeta Node. Do I need to do anything?**</summary>

# Blockport FAQ

## 1. About Blockport & The Rebrand
<details>
<summary>**Q: What is Blockport?**</summary>
* **A:** Blockport (`blockport.xyz`) is the new identity for the high-performance Solana validator previously known as Zeta Node. We're an independent infrastructure provider run by the same experienced team.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**Q: Why did Zeta Node rebrand to Blockport?**</summary>
* **A:** Rebranding allows us to focus independently on our mission: providing best-in-class staking and future infrastructure services (like RPCs) for the *entire* Solana ecosystem. It gives us the operational freedom to expand our offerings.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**Q: Is this related to the Zeta Markets / Bullet.xyz rebrand?**</summary>
* **A:** We maintain a positive relationship with Bullet.xyz, and they support this transition [link/mention endorsement if available]. However, Blockport is now a fully independent entity with its own distinct mission focused on foundational infrastructure.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**Q: Who is behind Blockport?**</summary>
* **A:** Blockport is operated by a team with deep Solana experience, including roles supporting early ecosystem growth and building with prominent DeFi protocols, backed by 3+ years of proven validator operation. [Link to personal blog post if desired].

## 2. For Delegators
<details>
<summary>**Q: I was staked with Zeta Node. Do I need to do anything?**</summary>

</details>
<details>
<summary>**Q: Is my staked SOL safe?**</summary>

</details>
## 3. Staking with Blockport & Fees
<details>
<summary>**Q: What are Blockport's commission fees?**</summary>
* **A:** We charge **0% inflation commission** and **8% MEV commission**. We currently retain 100% of block rewards as programmatic distribution is not yet feasible on Solana (this may change post-SIMD123).
</details>
<details>
<summary>**Q: Why 0% inflation commission?**</summary>
* **A:** We believe in maximizing direct staking rewards for our delegators. Our model focuses on performance-driven income (MEV/block rewards) and future services.

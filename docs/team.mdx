We believe in high-performance networks that enable open and globally accessible finance. For over three years, we’ve maintained a high-uptime Solana validator—earning the trust of over 205,000 staked SOL (currently $28M USD) and consistently ranking among the top validators on Jito Stakenet.

We offer individual Solana users and institutional stakeholders an independent, high-performance validator that keeps the network secure and delivers transparent, reliable yields—all at 0% commission. We bolster our primary server with an equally capable backup node, deploy automated scripts to minimize downtime, and maintain 24/7 on-call engineers supported by robust alerting systems.

At the helm of our operation are Nik Herrmann and Adrian Ciaffoncini. Nik is a networking specialist who spent over a decade building mission-critical IT projects for healthcare and government agencies. Adrian is an economics and finance graduate drawing on 12 years in financial services, including key roles in crypto-trading exchanges.

Underpinning our operation is the belief that decentralized global networks can substantially improve financial access. As hardware and networking continue to advance, technologies like Solana demonstrate the promise of a unified, hyperconnected financial system that is net neutral and decentralized.

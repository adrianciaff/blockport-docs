We believe in high-performance networks that enable open and globally accessible finance. For over three years, we’ve maintained a high-uptime Solana validator—earning the trust of over 225,000 staked SOL (currently <DynamicStakedValue />) and are consistently ranked among the top validators on [Jito Stakenet](https://www.jito.network/stakenet/steward/FnAPJkzf19s87sm24Qhv6bHZMZvZ43gjNUBRgjwXpD4v/).

At the helm of our operation are Nik Herrmann and Adrian Ciaffoncini. Nik is a networking specialist who spent over a decade building mission-critical IT projects for healthcare and government agencies. Adrian is an economics and finance graduate drawing on 12 years in financial services, including key roles in crypto-trading exchanges.

Underpinning our operation is the belief that decentralized global networks can substantially improve financial access. As hardware and networking continue to improve, technologies like Solana demonstrate the promise of a unified, hyperconnected financial system that offer net neutral and decentralized features.

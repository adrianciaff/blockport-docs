We believe in high-performance networks that enable open and globally accessible finance. For over three years, co-founders Nik Herrmann and Adrian Ciaffoncini have maintained a high-uptime Solana validatorâ€”earning the trust of over 225,000 staked SOL (currently <DynamicStakedValue />) and are consistently ranked among the top validators on [Jito Stakenet](https://www.jito.network/stakenet/steward/FnAPJkzf19s87sm24Qhv6bHZMZvZ43gjNUBRgjwXpD4v/).

Nik is a networking specialist who spent over a decade building mission-critical IT projects for healthcare and government agencies. Adrian is an economics and finance graduate drawing on 10 years in financial services and experience from key roles in prominent Solana teams.

As hardware and networking continue to improve, technologies like Solana demonstrate the promise of a digital, programmable financial system, built for the internet.

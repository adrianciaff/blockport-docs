* Consistent uptime exceeding 99.99% since inception (February 27, 2022: epoch 284).
^ Calculated based on the actual returns of staked accounts.

## Security

* Our infrastructure access requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) and hardware security modules (HSMs). We employ cutting-edge cryptography to protect sensitive assets against leaks, breaches, or future slashing risks.
* We combine industry-leading monitoring tools with proprietary scripts and around-the-clock manual checks by our team to ensure maximum reliability.
